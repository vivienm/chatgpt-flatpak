# ci-smoke.sh: post-install assertions for the CI smoke test step.
#
# Assumes the app is already installed under the given app id (the caller
# does remote-add + flatpak install first; that part differs between
# build.yml's throwaway CI repo and release.yml's published one, so it stays
# in the workflow, not here).
#
# No launch assertion: this container runs the job as root, and Chromium's
# zygote host hard-refuses to start its sandbox as root without --no-sandbox
# (see zygote_host_impl_linux.cc), which is forbidden in this repo since it
# would defeat the sandbox the packaging exists to keep. So a real launch
# cannot be asserted here; these payload assertions are what's left, and they
# are still real (apply_extra actually unpacked a real payload, not just a
# zero exit). The launch check is still valid to run locally, where the
# session isn't root:
#   flatpak run --nosocket=session-bus io.github.vivienm.ChatGPT
# Reaching "window ready-to-show" in its output is the signal.
