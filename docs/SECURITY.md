# Sandbox posture

## What this package does

**zypak, not `--no-sandbox`.** Electron's SUID sandbox helper cannot work inside
a flatpak. The common workaround in the existing repackagers is to pass
`--no-sandbox`, which does not disable "a" sandbox. It removes renderer and GPU
process isolation entirely. From then on, any compromised web content inherits
*everything the flatpak holds*: the network share, every `--filesystem=` grant,
every `--talk-name=`. For an app that stores an account credential and reads
source code, that collapses two boundaries at once.

`org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp` ships [zypak](https://github.com/refi64/zypak),
which intercepts Chromium's sandbox calls and runs each renderer in a nested
flatpak sub-sandbox instead. Nothing is stubbed out: upstream ships no
`chrome-sandbox` and the BaseApp no longer ships `stub_sandbox`, and zypak
takes over before Chromium looks for a helper. `apply_extra` therefore
asserts rather than installs. It refuses to install if `zypak-wrapper` is
missing, and aborts if upstream starts shipping a `chrome-sandbox`, since
either would mean the sandbox model changed and a human should look.
`--require-version=1.8.2` is in `finish-args` because zypak's faster spawn
strategy needs `expose-pids`.

**Codex commands use Flatpak as their process sandbox.** Codex normally uses
`bwrap` and a user namespace to create its own command sandbox. A process
already inside Flatpak cannot create that nested user namespace, so merely
shipping another `bwrap` does not make command execution work. At install time
this package preserves upstream's `app/resources/codex` as `codex.real` and
puts a small wrapper at the original path. The wrapper passes
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` to Codex because the
environment already provides isolation.

The bypass flag applies to Codex's inner layer, not the Flatpak or host.
two potential layers:

1. Codex's inner command sandbox is disabled because Flatpak prevents it from
   being created.
2. The outer Flatpak sandbox remains in force for Codex, its shell commands,
   and the desktop app.

Model-generated commands can therefore use everything already visible inside
the Flatpak: explicitly granted workspace directories, app-persistent data in
`.codex` and `.cache`, the shared network, runtime tools, devices, and allowed
D-Bus services. They still cannot read arbitrary host files or execute host
commands. Granting `--filesystem=host`, broad home access, or
`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` would erase those protections and is not
part of this compatibility fix. Chromium renderer and GPU process isolation
continues to use zypak unchanged.

**Sealed permissions.** Deliberately absent from `finish-args`:

| Not granted | Why |
|---|---|
| `--filesystem=host` / `=home` | the app sees no user files until you say so |
| `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` | this permits `flatpak-spawn --host`, i.e. arbitrary command execution outside the sandbox. Flathub treats it as an exception-requiring rule. VS Code holds it, plus `--filesystem=host` and `--allow=devel`, which is why a flatpak'd VS Code is not meaningfully confined |
| `--device=all` | `--device=dri` covers GPU without handing over every USB device |
| `--socket=x11` / `--socket=fallback-x11` | Both are explicitly denied. The launcher requires native Wayland, so X11-only sessions are unsupported. Network-shared abstract sockets remain a separate limitation, described below. |
| `--share=ipc` | Explicitly denied: native Wayland does not need the host IPC namespace used for X11 shared memory. |

**Credential service.** Only `org.freedesktop.secrets` is allowed for credential
storage. The launcher explicitly selects Electron's `gnome-libsecret` backend,
matching this fork's GNOME Keyring setup. Direct access to `org.kde.kwalletd5`
and `org.kde.kwalletd6` is not granted. This narrows the reachable services; it
does not restrict Secret Service access to this application's own items.
Access control and unlocking remain the provider's responsibility.

Keep a working Secret Service provider: removing all keyring access or choosing
`--password-store=basic` can leave Electron storage without meaningful encryption.
See [Electron safeStorage](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage).
Changing from a previous KWallet-backed installation requires checking credential
migration or signing in again; do not delete the old wallet to troubleshoot it.

Audio playback and microphone access (`--socket=pulseaudio`) are intentionally
retained, as is the Codex command-sandbox bypass described above.

Grant the minimum you need, per directory:

```sh
flatpak override --user --filesystem=~/code/thisproject io.github.vivienm.ChatGPT
flatpak override --user --show io.github.vivienm.ChatGPT     # review
flatpak override --user --reset io.github.vivienm.ChatGPT    # start over
```

The trade is real: with a sealed sandbox the agent can only run commands against
the tools inside the runtime, not your host toolchain. If you widen it to
`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` to get host execution back, you have
opted out of the sandbox. Do that knowingly, not by copying a snippet.

## Chrome native messaging

The browser controller / Chrome extension native transport is unsupported in this Flatpak package, including when Chrome itself runs as a Flatpak. The extension may report `Native transport disconnected`, and the desktop app may show Chrome as "Not installed" even when the extension is installed. These symptoms do not mean broader Flatpak permissions are needed.

A local native-messaging bridge experiment was withdrawn because it stored a host executable in data writable by the Flatpak. Code running inside the sandbox could modify that executable and change what Chrome later runs outside the sandbox. This experiment was not a supported package feature.

This design is consistent with [CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html): sandboxed code could modify code that would later execute on the host. CWE-732 is a general weakness classification, not a published advisory or CVE for this package.

There is no supported permission workaround, including a temporary one. A temporary filesystem grant does not protect a persistent host wrapper when the Flatpak can modify it later. Granting `org.freedesktop.Flatpak` access to enable `flatpak-spawn --host`, or broad host filesystem access, would weaken the intended sandbox without fixing that design.

Any future integration would need a separate security assessment. Host-executed code and its configuration must remain outside Flatpak-writable storage, including writable parent directories and symlink targets; protecting those files alone would not establish that the communication channel is safe.

## Codex Security scans

Codex Security scans must be started from **Security → Scans → + Scan** so the
workbench registers a `CODEX_SECURITY_SCAN_ID`. An error that the desktop
capability `start_codex_security_prompt_only_scan` is unavailable is separate
from command sandboxing. If it remains after this Codex wrapper fix, it points
to an app/plugin version or feature-integration mismatch, not a missing Flatpak
permission. Do not widen filesystem or D-Bus access to work around it.

## What this package does not do

**No network egress filtering.** `--share=network` is all-or-nothing; flatpak
has no destination-level control and the request for it
([flatpak#3054](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/3054)) was closed.
Network access additionally exposes host services listening on abstract unix
sockets. If you need default-deny egress you must build it outside flatpak: a
dedicated network namespace around the launch, or nftables matching the app's
`app-flatpak-*.scope` cgroup.

**Not a trust boundary for other people's code.** Flatpak 1.17.4 (Apr 2026)
fixed a complete sandbox escape to host code execution; 1.19.0 (11 Aug 2026)
fixed ten more, including a path traversal in *extra-data extraction*
specifically. The flatpak boundary is a good usability and blast-radius
boundary. It is not where you should place a credential or client-data
boundary. For work under a client engagement, run the agent in a container cell
with its own credentials and a default-deny egress policy, and keep this
flatpak for personal use.

**Every install reaches OpenAI's CDN directly.** `extra-data` is fetched
per-machine at install and repair time; it cannot be baked into an OS image. On
a fleet with an egress policy, mirror the `.deb` to an internal artifact store
and repoint `url:`, which also gives you a stable hash and removes the rolling-URL
problem entirely.

## Supply chain

- The vendor payload is pinned by `sha256` + `size` and verified by flatpak
  before `apply_extra` runs. A rotated artifact fails the install rather than
  installing unknown bytes.
- The repo is GPG-signed. Signing is not cosmetic here: flatpak refuses
  system-wide installs of extra-data apps from sources that are not
  gpg-verified.
- `apply_extra` fails closed on unexpected layout instead of proceeding.
- No OpenAI executable code is rebuilt, patched into a binary artifact, or
  re-hosted. The one exception is artwork: `build-aux/icons/` holds seven PNGs
  downscaled from the icon in upstream's `.deb`, committed because AppStream
  metadata and icons must exist at build time while the payload only arrives at
  install time. Regenerate them with `make icons`.

## Reporting

Packaging issues: open an issue here. Bugs in the ChatGPT application itself go
to OpenAI. Reproduce them with the official `.deb` first, since this packaging
does change the process sandbox and the filesystem view.
